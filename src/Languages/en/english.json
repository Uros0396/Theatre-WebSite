    "title1": "STUDIO",
    "title2": "WORKSHOPS",
    "paragraph1": "Our productions are interconnected through symbolic elements to create a narrative that delves into recurring themes: home,memory, family, childhood, bodies, loss, death, emptiness. The memories of our families and childhood, traumas, ancestors, places and objects that recall them, inhabit the stage or exhibition space. Ideas can arise from any source: a photograph taken with our grandfather’s old Minolta camera, or a novel. Fairy tales, poems, and classical themes convey a timeless feeling to our new creations. Images, words and sounds converge in live-sets or audiovisual recordings. We are working cross-sectionally on both performances and site-specific projects.",
    "paragraph2": "Our technical work focuses on the design of feelings and sensations, in order to create atmospheres through the combination of materials and contrasts, alternating objects, bodies, and textures. An artistic synthesis emerges at a later stage after a long communal intellectual process, translating conceptual and tangible analyses into more abstract, illogical visions. Imagined creatures and childlike elements merge with the brutality of reality and our reflections on the times we live in. While our works may be raw in their attempt to represent the most controversial aspects of the present, they are imbued with the emotional weight of our personal stories, and those of the people we meet. We listen and observe. We collect interviews and experiences in the rehearsal room and use them as drafts for new projects. When we open our research to others during our workshops, we observe how bodies interact with the spaces that host us, with architectures, how they blend with the external matter, and how they change with the landscape.",
    "paragraph3": "Our research lies in liminal spaces, in the voids left by doubts about the new artistic expressions. Theatre is a vital part of an open negotiation with the representation of the world. Many of us have had a close relationship with theatre before, which in time has brought us questioning and defining it as an often outdated language. What interests us is finding creative paths beyond the constraints of definition, crossing all disciplines without the moral duty of being up-to-date. Performance, dance, and photography alone will not extinguish our questions, but they are our practice of freedom. The desire to create is ruthless, and art is our refuge, the place where we can perceive that ruthlessness and lean into the perversion of looking. Looking, even at sad things, from a sort of free trade zone. Performance art, especially, is the most violent way of looking, because it allows projections and creates reality itself, whereas working on the material plane is an exercise of contemplation. In our creations we use all available means, without imposing any formal limits, escaping from categorization.",
